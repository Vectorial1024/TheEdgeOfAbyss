# TheEdgeOfAbyss
Don't bring your colonists over the edge... or face brutal consequences.

The Edge of Abyss is a RimWorld mod that inserts only 1 key feature: the Edge of Abyss (duh).

When your colonists are unhappy enough, you will be notified that the colonists are "at the edge of abyss". If you choose to continue ignoring your colonists' well-being, your colonists will feel worse and worse, triggering more metal breaks, and eventually, trigger the Abyss.

The Abyss is a special incident that works as a mental-break-giving mechanism independent of the vanilla MB system. Depending on the severity of the colonists' mood, different mental breaks will be given to the colonists, with special focus for the following mental breaks:

## Minor mental breaks
- Hide in room
- Sad wander

## Major mental breaks
- Psychotic wandering
- Social drug binge

## Extreme mental breaks
- Catatonia
- Given up and leaving
- Jailbreaker
- Run wild
