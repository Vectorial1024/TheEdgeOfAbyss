[h1]The Edge of Abyss[/h1]
This mod adds in a new system: Hope. You can think of this as an extension to the vanilla Mood system. Hope and Mood compliment each other; good mood will inspire high hope, and high hope will grant a mood bonus. This is the same with poor mood and low hope.

There are two (planned or WIP) types of Hope: Transient and Persistent. See GitHub documentation for more details.

[list]
[*]Transient Hope: "little hopes" that exist within your daily life, such as eating, sleeping, and having fun; they can change throughout the day
[*]Persistent Hope: more significant form of hope that is compared more to the "life events", such as marriages, rivals, deaths, and kidnaps; they are unlikely to change, and are considered to have constant strength until some event/incident happens
[/list]

There will eventually be more types of hope available for the Colonists. There will also be more varied bonuses/penalties due to hope for the Colonists.

Do not expect quick updates, because real life has just become very tricky for all of us, including me.

Still, may your glorious Colonists stay safe and healthy in the isolated corners of the Rim!
