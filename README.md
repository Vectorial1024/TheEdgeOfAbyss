# TheEdgeOfAbyss
Inspire hope among your people. Or not.

The Edge of Abyss is a RimWorld mod that introduces a new system to complement the vanilla Mood system: the Hope system.

Under the Hope system, a good mood will contribute to high hope, and high hope will grant a mood bonus. Both systems interact with each other to create something more interesting.

# Previous Releases

You will find previous releases in the `Releases` folder in this repo, but not in GitHub's "Releases" section, because I find the former approach more convenient.

Steps to download them:

1. Navigate to the `Releases` folder in the repo, click on the folder
2. Find and click on the `7z` file that you wish to download
3. Click "Download" on the right side of the page
4. Follow standard file-downloading procedures
