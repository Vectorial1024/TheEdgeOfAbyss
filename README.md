# The Edge Of Abyss
Inspire hope among your people. Or not.

The Edge of Abyss is a RimWorld mod that introduces a new system to complement the vanilla Mood system: the Hope system.

Under the Hope system, a good mood will contribute to high hope, and high hope will grant a mood bonus. Both systems interact with each other to create something more interesting.
