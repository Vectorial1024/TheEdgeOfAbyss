- Hope: a number
- Good events increase hope
- Bad events decrease hope
- Value tends to 0 (adjusted by Optimistic/Pessimistic traits)
- Will have a Thought that is based on hope; high hope means good thought, low hope means bad thought
- (feeling terrible may perhaps be integrated to the ope mechanics)

- Generalized deployment: now listens to the tale manager and makes "permanent tales" instead
- News spread
- Bad news affect hope

Social mechanics
- [Abstract, we are still thinking about this even back in Desync]
